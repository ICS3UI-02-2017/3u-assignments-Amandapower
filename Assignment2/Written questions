Evaluate the following Boolean expressions for a Robot. Assume the robot is on intersection (1, 5) facing north. There is a Wall immediately in front of it. 
In each case your answer will be either true or false.
this.getAvenue() > 0 - True
this.getAvenue() <= 5 - True
this.getStreet() != 1 - False
!(this.getStreet() == 1) - False
this.frontIsClear() - False 
!this.frontIsClear() - True 
this.frontIsClear() == false - True 

2. Consider the following if-else statements. Do they behave the same way or differently? Justify your answer.

Statement 1
if(karel.canPickThing())                                    
{                                                        
    karel.turnRight();                               
} else {                                                   
    karel.turnLeft();                                
}  
Statement 2
if(!karel.canPickThing())
{                                                                          
    karel.turnLeft();
} else {                                                                                                                          
    karel.turnRight();
}   

- they are saying the same thing just in different orders, statement one is 
saying that if karel can pick up the thing then karel turns right if he can't
then he turns left. Statement 2 is saying that if karel can not pick up the thing 
karel turns left if karel can pick up th thing he turns right. the same thing
just in different orders.
